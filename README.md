# EventsPlanning

## Introduction

  This project aim to provide efficient, powerfull, user friendly events planning tool to non-profits and small businesses.

## Goals 

  I create this project for my own learning interests. 
  
  I hope these interests are to evolve in the near future with something more fancy than the actual "Hello world !" div i wrote.

  I am more likely to see this project as a platform at the moment but i'm aware some may want to clone client and server individually or just take a proper component into their own app. Feel free to guide me on that decision since it is my first open-source project.
